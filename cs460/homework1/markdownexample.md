#HTML

###In this page I have left myself some notes on how to start an HTML page
###and how to make a table.


##To create and HTML5 document we need the following code:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Page Title</title>
    </head>
    <body>

        <h1>This is a Heading</h1>
        <p>This is a paragraph.</p>

    </body>
</html>
```
